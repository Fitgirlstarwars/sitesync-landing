## General Questions

### What is SiteSync?

SiteSync is an AI-powered building services platform that gives buildings permanent ownership of their service history. Unlike traditional contractor software, SiteSync's data belongs to the building—it stays with the property regardless of which contractors perform the work.

## For Building Managers

### What makes SiteSync different from other maintenance software?

Traditional CMMS/FSM software sells to contractors and helps them run their business. When you change contractors, your history often disappears with them.

**SiteSync is different:**
- You (the building) own all data
- History stays with the building forever
- Contractors access your data, not the other way around
- You maintain control and visibility

---

### How does data ownership work?

When you use SiteSync:
1. **You create the building profile** - you own it
2. **Contractors you invite can log work** - on YOUR record
3. **If you change contractors** - nothing changes for you
4. **The new contractor sees full history** - with your permission

Your building's institutional memory never disappears.

---

### What can I see that I couldn't before?

**Without SiteSync:**
- Service records scattered across contractors
- History lost when contractors change
- No visibility into equipment patterns
- Compliance tracking in spreadsheets

**With SiteSync:**
- Complete unified timeline
- All contractors' work in one place
- AI insights from your equipment's history
- Automated compliance tracking
- Building Health Score

---

### Do I need my contractor's permission?

No. You own the building and the data. You can:
- Start using SiteSync without contractor involvement
- Log service records yourself
- Import historical records
- Invite contractors when ready

When you invite a contractor, they can log work directly—but YOU always own the record.

---

### What if my contractor doesn't want to use SiteSync?

That's their choice, but it doesn't affect you:
- Log records yourself after service visits
- Upload their service reports (AI extracts data)
- Import their invoices and documentation
- Consider it when choosing future contractors

Many contractors appreciate that SiteSync is free for them to use and makes their work easier.

---

### What is Building Health Score?

A single number (0-100) representing your building's overall equipment condition:

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Equipment Condition | 25% |
| Maintenance Compliance | 25% |
| Incident Frequency | 20% |
| First-Time Fix Rate | 15% |
| Predictive Risk | 15% |

The score improves as you add more history and maintain equipment properly.

---

### Can I export my data?

Yes, always. You can export:
- Complete equipment records
- All work order history
- Compliance documents
- Audit trail
- Custom reports

Formats: PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON

Your data is never locked in.

---

## For Technicians

### Is SiteSync really free for technicians?

Yes, completely free:
- Create professional profile
- Access AI diagnosis
- Search knowledge base
- Log work
- Build reputation

No hidden fees. No trial. Free forever.

---

### Why is it free for technicians?

SiteSync's business model charges buildings, not technicians. We believe:
- Technicians shouldn't pay to do their jobs better
- Free access builds the community
- The more technicians contribute, the more valuable the platform

You're the experts. We want you here.

---

### How does the professional profile work?

Your profile includes:
- Verified job history (from completed work)
- Expertise score (grows with experience)
- Specializations (equipment brands, types)
- Certifications (upload and verify)
- Knowledge contributions
- Peer endorsements
- Badges and achievements

**Portable:** Your profile travels with you. Change employers? Your reputation stays.

---

### Can I use SiteSync on my resume?

Absolutely. Many technicians include:
- Profile link on resume/CV
- QR code on business cards
- Reference for job applications

Employers can see your verified work history and expertise (with your permission).

---

### What is the Knowledge Base?

A collective repository of solutions, tips, and procedures shared by technicians worldwide:
- Fault code solutions
- Equipment quirks
- Quick fixes
- Procedures
- Safety notes

**How it works:**
1. You solve a problem
2. Document the solution
3. Community accesses it
4. You get credit (expertise score)

---

### Can I contribute anonymously?

Yes. You can:
- Share knowledge without employer attribution
- Protect sensitive information
- Still earn private reputation credit
- Build the commons safely

Use the anonymous option when sharing.

---

### How does AI Diagnosis work?

1. Enter fault code or describe symptoms
2. AI analyzes against thousands of similar cases
3. Get probable cause, diagnostic steps, parts needed
4. Confidence score shows reliability

The AI learns from every resolved case, getting smarter over time.

---

### What about proprietary information?

SiteSync empowers technicians with knowledge that should be accessible:
- General troubleshooting approaches
- Common fault solutions
- Safety procedures

We do NOT encourage sharing:
- Trade secrets
- Proprietary schematics
- Confidential business information

Use good judgment. When in doubt, use anonymous mode or don't share.

---

## For Service Companies

### Why should my company use SiteSync?

**Operational benefits:**
- AI diagnosis for faster resolution
- Technician scheduling and dispatch
- Van stock management
- Parts marketplace access

**Business benefits:**
- Connect with building customers
- Showcase team expertise
- Recruit talented technicians
- Professional reputation

**It's free to start.** Pro features available for growing companies.

---

### Our technicians already have their own profiles. How does that work?

When a technician joins your company on SiteSync:
- Their profile remains theirs
- They link to your company
- Their work logs under both (company AND personal)
- If they leave, their profile goes with them

This is by design. Technicians own their careers. You get operational tools.

---

### Can we see our competitors' data?

No. You only see:
- Your company's data
- Buildings you're invited to service
- Public knowledge base (everyone sees this)

You cannot see other companies' customers, pricing, or operations.

---

### How do building relationships work?

Buildings invite contractors:
1. Building creates SiteSync account
2. Building invites your company
3. You accept invitation
4. You can now log work on their equipment
5. Building controls what you see

The building owns the relationship. This protects both parties.

---

### What if a building we service isn't on SiteSync?

Options:
- Suggest they sign up (free for basic use)
- Use SiteSync for your internal records
- Import their data if they sign up later

Your technicians can still use AI diagnosis and knowledge base regardless.
