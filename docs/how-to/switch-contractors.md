# How to Switch Contractors

> Change service providers without losing history

## Overview

One of SiteSync's core benefits: **your data stays with your building**, not with contractors. This guide walks you through changing service providers seamlessly.

## The SiteSync Advantage

**Traditional scenario:**
```
Old contractor leaves → History lost → Start from scratch
```

**With SiteSync:**
```
Old contractor leaves → Full history preserved → New contractor sees everything
```

---

## Step 1: Review Current Access

Before making changes, see who has access:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Contractors**
2. View all connected contractors
3. Note their current access levels

| Access Level | Permissions |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Full** | View, edit, complete work orders |
| **Limited** | View and complete assigned work only |
| **View-only** | See history, no editing |

---

## Step 2: Invite New Contractor

### Method A: Send Invitation

1. Click **+ Invite Contractor**
2. Enter contractor details:
   - Company name
   - Contact email
   - Trade type(s)
3. Set access level
4. Click **Send Invitation**

Contractor receives email:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Your Building Name] has invited you to SiteSync       │
│                                                         │
│  You've been invited to manage:                         │
│  • Lifts & Escalators (3 assets)                        │
│                                                         │
│  [ Accept Invitation ]                                  │
│                                                         │
│  SiteSync is free for contractors.                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Method B: Contractor Self-Registration

Share your building's connection code:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Building Code**
2. Share the code with new contractor
3. They enter it when joining SiteSync

---

## Step 3: Transfer Access

### Grant Access to New Contractor

1. Select new contractor
2. Choose assets they'll service
3. Set permissions
4. Optionally share historical context

### Share History (Recommended)

Grant new contractor access to see:
- Past work orders (read-only)
- Equipment quirks and notes
- Known issues and resolutions

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Share history with ABC Lifts?              │
│                                             │
│  ☑ Past work orders (last 2 years)         │
│  ☑ Equipment notes and quirks              │
│  ☐ Cost/pricing history                    │
│                                             │
│  [ Share Selected ]  [ Skip ]               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Step 4: Revoke Old Contractor Access

Once new contractor is set up:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Contractors**
2. Select old contractor
3. Click **Revoke Access**
4. Confirm

**Important:** Revoking access does NOT delete their work history. All records remain with your building.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Revoke access for XYZ Services?            │
│                                             │
│  • They will no longer access your building │
│  • All their work history is preserved      │
│  • Open work orders will need reassignment  │
│                                             │
│  [ Revoke Access ]  [ Cancel ]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Step 5: Reassign Open Work Orders

If there are pending jobs:

1. Go to **Work Orders** → filter by old contractor
2. Select open work orders
3. Click **Reassign**
4. Choose new contractor

---

## What New Contractors See

When they accept your invitation:

| Information | Visibility |
|-------------|------------|
| Asset list | Full |
| Equipment specs | Full |
| Active work orders | Assigned only |
| Historical work orders | Based on your sharing settings |
| Other contractors' work | Only summaries |
| Pricing/costs | Never (unless you share) |

---

## If Your Contractor Doesn't Use SiteSync

You can still track work:

1. **Log work yourself** — Enter job details after service
2. **Share read-only access** — Contractor views, you enter
3. **Use it as a differentiator** — Ask new contractors if they support SiteSync

Many contractors appreciate that SiteSync is free for them.

| Day 8 | Revoke old contractor access |

## FAQ

### Does the old contractor keep any data?

No. Your building's data stays with you. The contractor only retains their own internal records (if any).

### Can I have multiple contractors at once?

Yes. Many buildings have different contractors for different trades, or backup contractors.

### What if I want to switch back?

Simply re-invite them. History is preserved.
