### Counter-Positioning

| Incumbent Approach | SiteSync Approach |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sell to contractors | **Sell to buildings** |
| Data belongs to contractor | **Data belongs to building** |
| $299-899/month | **$29/month** |
| Weeks to setup | **5 minutes** |
| Dedicated training | **No training needed** |
| Features for contractor operations | **Features for building intelligence** |

**Why incumbents can't respond:**
- Their customers (contractors) benefit from data ownership
- Pivoting to buildings would alienate existing base
- Their pricing model depends on contractor value capture
- They're strategically paralyzed

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Focus | Pricing | Weakness |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| ServiceTitan | Contractors | $299+/mo | Sells to contractors, not buildings |
| Fiix | Asset maintenance | $200+/mo | General purpose, no trade expertise |
| UpKeep | Maintenance | $150+/mo | Not building-focused |
| Limble | CMMS | $100+/mo | No AI, no marketplace |

### Indirect Competitors

| Competitor | Description | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Spreadsheets | Manual tracking | Automation, intelligence |
| Paper records | Traditional approach | Digital, searchable, permanent |
| Manufacturer systems | Proprietary tools | Multi-vendor, building-owned |

### Competitive Response Scenarios

**If ServiceTitan pivots to buildings:**
- Would alienate existing contractor customers
- Can't match our price without destroying margins
- Lacks building-centric DNA
- We'll have 2-3 year head start

**If manufacturer offers free tools:**
- Lock-in to single vendor
- Building managers want independence
- Can't match multi-vendor intelligence

- More techs → better collective knowledge
- More data → smarter AI

### 3. Switching Costs

- Years of building history
- Trained AI on specific equipment
- Compliance records
- Integration with workflows

### 4. Counter-Positioning

- Incumbents can't copy without destroying business
- First mover in building-centric model
- Occupying strategic position

### 5. Brand Moat
